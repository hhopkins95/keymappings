repo for remapping keybindings to home row mods, and some relevant configs for different programs -- 


Uses Karabiner-Elements -- download from here :

Mix of two methods that I found : 
1. Hyper Key -- https://github.com/mxstbr/karabiner/tree/main / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4b_uQX3Vu0
- remaps CapsLock to a 'Hyper' (holds ctrl + cmd + alt + shift at the same time) key + "layers" (spaces on top of the hyper key) 
- looks like he calls functions on apps directly, rather than using their own shortcuts
- will use this for system-level shortcuts -- like changing window focus, switching tabs, etc.


1. Home Row Mods --https://havn.blog/2024/03/03/a-good-way.html / https://github.com/Erlendms/karabiner-actions
- this lets us remap certain keys to emit different events if they are held -- we can use this to remap home row keys to ctrl, alt, shift, etc.
- set up shortcuts on the application level to be compatible here
